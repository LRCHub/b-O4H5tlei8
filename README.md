[00:04.82] (Give me, give me, give me something)
[00:06.66] (Give me, give me something)
[00:09.09] (Oh, oh give me something)
[00:22.09] 
[00:12.43] Switched a light, cracked a door
[00:16.34] Started wishing, found a mission
[00:20.26] Break a glass, ring the bell
[00:24.14] Superstition, but I've been wishin'
[00:28.59] For someone that I can see with my humanity
[00:33.02] In the mirror, just a little clearer
[00:36.90] Just look at the warning signs, I see the good die
[00:41.35] Yeah, it's nearer, won't shed a tear
[00:59.35] 
[00:45.43] I looked for gold
[00:47.10] Then it turned, it turned to rust
[00:52.75] I'll look for fate
[00:55.74] If it leads, it leads to us
[01:09.24] 
[01:01.45] Give me something
[01:04.43] Somewhere to go, someone that I'd know, I'm chasing the glow
[01:10.62] Give me something
[01:12.74] Someone to love, someone to count these stars above
[01:18.94] Give me something
[01:27.44] 
[01:21.21] Tell me lies, make it up
[01:25.21] Paint the picture, take me with ya
[01:29.32] I don't care with what you say, I'm makin' it here today
[01:33.53] It's a new world, it's a new world
[01:37.86] I don't care with where this goes, I'm makin' it, highs and lows
[01:41.93] It's a new world, it's a new world
[01:58.93] 
[01:46.22] Give me something
[01:48.09] Somewhere to go, someone that I'd know, I'm chasing the glow
[01:54.37] Give me something
[01:56.48] Someone to love, someone to count these stars above
[02:02.77] Give me something
[02:11.27] 
[02:03.91] (Give me, give me, give me something)
[02:05.51] (Give me, give me something)
[02:08.03] (Oh, oh give me something)
[02:12.18] (Give me, give me, give me something)
[02:13.83] (Give me, give me something)
[02:16.39] (Oh, oh give me something)
[02:29.39] 
[02:19.36] Give me something
[02:22.08] Somewhere to go, someone that I'd know, I'm chasing the glow
[02:27.88] Give me something
[02:29.89] Someone to love, someone to count these stars above
[02:36.17] Give me something
